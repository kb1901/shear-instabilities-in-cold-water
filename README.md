This repository contains animation videos that are added as supplementary material to the Physical Review Fluids accepted manuscript "Effects of weak buoyancy in shear instabilities in cold water". 
There are two animation videos:
- med_Re_animation: This shows the evolution of the instability for the medium $Re$ current regime ($Re = 60$) cases B (base), P ($Pr=1$) and L (linear equation of state). We notice the differences in the dynamics observed in all three cases.
- strong_Re_animation: This shows the evolution of the instability for the strong $Re$ current regime ($Re = 120$) cases SB (strong, base), SP (strong, $Pr=1$) and SL (strong, linear equation of state). The differences between the flows exist, but are diminished in this case.
